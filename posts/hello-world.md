# Hello World

Welcome to my new academic homepage! I built this site using **Next.js** and **Markdown**.

## Why a Blog?

As a PhD student, I find it important to document my learning process and share my research findings. This blog will serve as a platform for:

- Research updates
- Tutorial on technical topics
- Thoughts on academic life

Stay tuned for more updates!
